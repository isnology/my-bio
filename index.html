          <p>
            Hi, my name is Glenn, I am a guy who likes to build things, both in the physical world and the digital world.
            I have a welder and lathe for old school metal work and a 3D printer for 21st century creativity.
            I am passionate about clean energy and man made global warming. I own an electric motorbike and look forward
            to the day that all transport is electric, and all energy is clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            I follow the Brisbane Lions (formerly Fitzroy) footy team as a family tradition, and have 2 kids, son 10 and
            daughter 8 years old, both of whom have no interest in footy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been a programmer on an IBM AS/400 and now I am a full stack web developer thanks to bootcamp at Coder
            Academy. The web has a bright future and I want to be a part of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find developing very rewarding and the web is full of possibilities, a place to bring ideas to life with
            minimal boundaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to be a full stack developer so that I have all the skills needed to build a website. Starting
            with a blank page (as start ups do) and designing the application I find appealing.
