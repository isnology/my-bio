        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Glenn, I am a guy who likes to build things, both in the physical world and the digital world.
          I have a welder and lathe for old school metal work and a 3D printer for 21st century creativity.
          I am passionate about clean energy and man made global warming. I own an electric motorbike and look forward
          to the day that all transport is electric, and all energy is clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          I follow the Brisbane Lions (formerly Fitzroy) footy team as a family tradition, and have 2 kids, son 10 and
          daughter 8 years old, both of whom have no interest in footy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been a programmer on an IBM AS/400 and now I am a full stack web developer thanks to bootcamp at Coder
          Academy. The web has a bright future and I want to be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find developing very rewarding and the web is full of possibilities, a place to bring ideas to life with
          minimal boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to be a full stack developer so that I have all the skills needed to build a website. Starting
          with a blank page (as start ups do) and designing the application I find appealing.

        <h2>My thoughts on Electric Vs Petrol</h2>
        <div class="passion">

          <p>
            I am passionate about electric vehicles and man made global warming. I own a Zero SR electric motorbike because
            it is electric but also as a means of doing something rather than just saying something. It’s great to believe
            that we need clean energy and to do something to cut emissions but it’s way better to DO something about it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Electric vehicles are so much fun to drive/ride even though they don’t make a cool noise, the instant torque is
            intoxicating and hard to explain to a “petrol head”. You need to experience it, to understand, and once you do
            you will be a convert.

        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
          IT professional with over 25 years of experience in IBM I (OS/400). Provide programming solutions to various
          heterogeneous networks with IBM i as the central hub. Experience in RPG programming and SQL with exposure to PHP
          and C languages, UNIX and Windows operating systems. Extensive practical knowledge of the RPG language both
          fixed format and free format as well as the “Old Programming Model” (OPM) and the
          “Integrated Language Environment” (ILE) methodologies, also CL programming. Solid experience in DDS and DDL
          database definition languages, SDA, “Rational Developer for i” and IBM i operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have some experience with TCP/IP networks and
          CISCO routers, and IBM I operations, giving me a good all round knowledge of IBM I and how it interacts with the
          world. A good team player, willing to share my business and technical “know how” with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been studying Ruby and Rails after taking a “step back and viewing the landscape” I see the IBM I is an
          ageing platform and is diminishing in popularity with time. I feel the better career path forward is with
          Ruby/Rails and web development. Ruby seems to have “come of age” now having finally moved past version 1.8 to
          the the current 2.4, and is heading in the right direction with version 3.0. I have read several books on Ruby,
          Rails, HTML, CSS and java script. I have done some online tutorials in rails as well. I am very open the the
          different way web applications are designed but can also bring a fresh set of ideas to throw into the mix if
          the usual web solution strategies don’t fit a new cutting edge idea.

        <h2>Career History and Achievements</h2>

        <h2>Non IT work</h2>
        <h4>September 2013 - Present</h4>

        <p>
          I have had a break from IT after about 25 years on IBM I, and now looking to get into WEB development. I
          have been doing self study of Ruby, Rails and relevant web languages.
        </p>
        <h2>Pacific Brands Services Group</h2>
        <h4>November 2001 - September 2013</h4>
        <p>Senior Analyst/Programmer</p>
        <p>
          Pacific Brands is a publicly listed company with head office in Melbourne and offices in Sydney, NZ, UK and
          China and warehouses in each state of Australia, NZ, UK and Dubai, employing several thousand staff and
          divided into 5 main companies trading under about 20 company names. Originally the 20 companies operated on
          various systems and software, but were all brought onto the IBM i and the ERP software package. This was
          originally the ACS ERP system but with years of modification to suit Pacific Brands.
        </p>
        <h3>Achievements include:</h3>
        <p>
          Successfully developed conversion programs to migrate 7 Pacific Brands companies to the IBM i. This was a
          major portion of my time at Pacific brands, with some migrations taking up to a year to complete due to
          enhancements to the existing IBM I ERP software (known as BOB) to support specific company needs. I
          reduced run time on these conversions from a maximun of 12 hours down to just 1 hour by optimising code
          and algorithms
        </p>
        <p>
          Successfully developed an ROA (Rational Open Access) generic IFS CSV file reader for use in conversion
          programs and general applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successfully developed an automated system to place orders on an external worldwide printing company for
          box carton labels that would be dispatched from the companies’ branches to our manufacturers in diverse
          locations within Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system interrogated the manufacturing files and sent requests for the specific number of labels
          required to all manufacturing sites. It took into account quantity increases and additional products
          added to existing orders, detected failed uploads and re-sent on next run, as well as, be run on an
          add-hock basis and catered for manual re-sends. It used SFTP to communicate the data. It kept a full
          history of what was sent and when.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instrumental in rationalising company-specific versions of the same programs into one base version by
          introducing a “switch file” and a service program (with procedure) to retrieve a true/false value. E.g.
          if the procedure returned True the following code was to be executed for this company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presented the case to Business Analysts and peers to adopt “switch file” as a rule – all new programs
          were to be a base version utilising this switching technique as well as applying any modifications to the
          base version and consolidating any existing company specific versions into the base version. Once
          completed this reduced time spent on modifications dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steered the programming group into to most current programming techniques, tools, enhancements of the
          language and standards as a member of the Technical Team. This included coding in free format and using
          ILE service programs where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Down loaded, installed and evaluated Profound Logic’s ProfoundUI GUI development environment for IBM i by
          writing some test applications using this tool along with converting existing applications using the tools
          conversion option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provided extensive technical support to programmers on aspects of RPG, ILE and communicating with other
          systems (UNIX, WINDOWS).
        </p>
        <p>
          Reduced the run time of conversions from 12 hours down to 1 hour using various techniques. The largest
          companies were migrated last, the largest order pool converted was 20,000,000 records. This necessitated
          the performance improvements.
        </p>
