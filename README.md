Installing Node.js to run Gulp to run postcss
-
- [Gulp & Node install](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/getting-started-with-gulp-js/)
- [postcss install](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/introduction-to-postcss/)


I changed gulp to run SASS and Autoprefixer via PostCSS's nextcss. I started using 'lost' for formatting but this 
proved to have its own problems, so I switch back to SASS and used flex for layout. This allowed me to do what I needed.

My Site Journey
=

- My audience will be prospective employers
- assumptions - if they use IE 8 then do I want to really work there?
- I wanted a single page site

Figma

I started with a Mood board, colours and Figma for design. 
Once done I then set up the directory structure, git, 
netlify, build tool (gulp etc) and domain name so I could concentrate on building the site. 

I did some test ideas in codepen before actually starting on the site.

Problems Encounted
=

I changed gulp to run SASS and Autoprefixer via PostCSS's nextcss. I started using 'lost' for formatting but this 
proved to have its own problems, so I switch back to SASS and used flex for layout. This allowed me to do what I needed.

I had lots of problems with the "contact me" email system. I used FORMSPREE as it delivers the email into your mailbox.
I found it only works from a server hosted web page and on the mobile after a lot of stuffing around to get the 
format of the input fields consistem between the browser and the phone. It also turns out that if you save an icon to
 your desktop to make the web page look like an app the email doesn't work, but it does if used within the browser.
 
I also struggled with what content to put in the site and the design aspect of the site.

Things I would do Differently/Want to add
=

- Number 1 would be to use Trello so I could track bugs without being distracted from the current problem.
- Extra navigation to return to top.
- More content.
