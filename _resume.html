    <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
    <p>
      For the past 7 months I have been doing the bootcamp course at Coder Academy with a view to be a full stack
      web developer. Studying HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Node.js. Prior to this I worked on the IBM I
      (AS/400) providing programming solutions to various heterogeneous networks with IBM i as the central hub coding
      in RPG and SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a good team player, willing to share my business and technical “know how” with others.

    <h1>Career History and Achievements</h1>

    <h2>Coder Academy Bootcamp course</h2>
    <h4>July 2017 - March 2018</h4>

    <p>
      Learning HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js and various tools
    </p>

    <h2>Non IT work</h2>
    <h4>September 2013 - July 2017</h4>

    <p>
      I had a break from IT after many years on IBM I, this is a dying platform with jobs drying up so I am now
      getting into WEB development. I did self-study of Ruby, Rails and relevant web languages as well as some other
      laboring work to keep some money coming in.

    <h2>Pacific Brands Services Group</h2>
    <h4>November 2001 - September 2013</h4>
    <p>Senior Analyst/Programmer</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Achievements include:</h3>
    <p>
      Successfully developed conversion programs to migrate 7 Pacific Brands companies to the IBM i. I
      reduced run time on these conversions from a maximum of 12 hours down to just 1 hour by optimising code
      and algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successfully developed an ROA (Rational Open Access) generic IFS CSV file reader for use in conversion
      programs and general applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successfully developed an automated system to place orders on an external worldwide printing company for
      box carton labels that would be dispatched from the companies’ branches to our manufacturers in diverse
      locations within Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instrumental in rationalising company-specific versions of the same programs into one base version by
      introducing a “switch file” and a service program (with procedure) to retrieve a true/false value. E.g.
      if the procedure returned True the following code was to be executed for this company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steered the programming group into to most current programming techniques, tools, enhancements of the
      language and standards as a member of the Technical Team. This included coding in free format and using
      ILE service programs where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down loaded, installed and evaluated Profound Logic’s ProfoundUI GUI development environment for IBM i by
      writing some test applications using this tool along with converting existing applications using the tools
      conversion option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provided extensive technical support to programmers on aspects of RPG, ILE and communicating with other
      systems (UNIX, WINDOWS).
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced the run time of conversions from 12 hours down to 1 hour using various techniques. The largest
      companies were migrated last, the largest order pool converted was 20,000,000 records.
