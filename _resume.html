    <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
    <p>
      For the past 7 months I have been doing the bootcamp course at Coder Academy with a view to be a full stack
      web developer. Studying HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Node.js. Prior to this I worked on the IBM I
      (AS/400) providing programming solutions to various heterogeneous networks with IBM i as the central hub coding
