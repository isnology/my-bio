    <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
    <p>
      For the past 7 months I have been doing the bootcamp course at Coder Academy with a view to be a full stack
      web developer. Studying HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Node.js. Prior to this I worked on the IBM I
      (AS/400) providing programming solutions to various heterogeneous networks with IBM i as the central hub coding
      in RPG and SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a good team player, willing to share my business and technical “know how” with others.

    <h2>Pacific Brands Services Group</h2>
    <h4>November 2001 - September 2013</h4>
    <p>Senior Analyst/Programmer</p>
    <p>
      Pacific Brands is a publicly listed company with head office in Melbourne and offices in Sydney, NZ, UK and
      China and warehouses in each state of Australia, NZ, UK and Dubai, employing several thousand staff and
      divided into 5 main companies trading under about 20 company names. Originally the 20 companies operated on
      various systems and software, but were all brought onto the IBM i and the ERP software package. This was
      originally the ACS ERP system but with years of modification to suit Pacific Brands.
    </p>
    <h3>Achievements include:</h3>
    <p>
      Successfully developed conversion programs to migrate 7 Pacific Brands companies to the IBM i. This was a
      major portion of my time at Pacific brands, with some migrations taking up to a year to complete due to
      enhancements to the existing IBM I ERP software (known as BOB) to support specific company needs. I
      reduced run time on these conversions from a maximun of 12 hours down to just 1 hour by optimising code
      and algorithms
    </p>
    <p>
      Successfully developed an ROA (Rational Open Access) generic IFS CSV file reader for use in conversion
      programs and general applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successfully developed an automated system to place orders on an external worldwide printing company for
      box carton labels that would be dispatched from the companies’ branches to our manufacturers in diverse
      locations within Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system interrogated the manufacturing files and sent requests for the specific number of labels
      required to all manufacturing sites. It took into account quantity increases and additional products
      added to existing orders, detected failed uploads and re-sent on next run, as well as, be run on an
      add-hock basis and catered for manual re-sends. It used SFTP to communicate the data. It kept a full
      history of what was sent and when.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instrumental in rationalising company-specific versions of the same programs into one base version by
      introducing a “switch file” and a service program (with procedure) to retrieve a true/false value. E.g.
      if the procedure returned True the following code was to be executed for this company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presented the case to Business Analysts and peers to adopt “switch file” as a rule – all new programs
      were to be a base version utilising this switching technique as well as applying any modifications to the
      base version and consolidating any existing company specific versions into the base version. Once
      completed this reduced time spent on modifications dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steered the programming group into to most current programming techniques, tools, enhancements of the
      language and standards as a member of the Technical Team. This included coding in free format and using
      ILE service programs where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down loaded, installed and evaluated Profound Logic’s ProfoundUI GUI development environment for IBM i by
      writing some test applications using this tool along with converting existing applications using the tools
      conversion option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provided extensive technical support to programmers on aspects of RPG, ILE and communicating with other
      systems (UNIX, WINDOWS).
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced the run time of conversions from 12 hours down to 1 hour using various techniques. The largest
      companies were migrated last, the largest order pool converted was 20,000,000 records. This necessitated
      the performance improvements.
