          I am passionate about electric vehicles and man made global warming. I own a Zero SR electric motorbike because
          it is electric but also as a means of doing something rather than just saying something. It’s great to believe
          that we need clean energy and to do something to cut emissions but it’s way better to DO something about it.

          Electric vehicles are so much fun to drive/ride even though they don’t make a cool noise, the instant torque is
          intoxicating and hard to explain to a “petrol head”. You need to experience it, to understand, and once you do
          you will be a convert.
